"""You are in a room with a circle of 100 chairs. The chairs are 

numbered sequentially from 1 to 100.

At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be asked to 

leave. The person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in 

chair #3 will be asked to leave. This pattern of skipping one 

person and asking the next to leave will keep going around the 

circle until there is one person leftâ€¦ the survivor.

Write a program to determine which chair the survivor is sitting in."""
